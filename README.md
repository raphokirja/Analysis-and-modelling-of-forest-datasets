# Analysis-and-modelling-of-forest-datasets

This work covered the analysis and visualization of forest data as well as the development of predictive models. The codes are written in R and the report in R Markdown. The objective was to find the appropriate explanatory features and build models based on them. Field selection was carried out based on:

(a)	Analysis and visualization

(b)	StepAIC algorithm 

Various linear models were explored. Using established statistical criteria, the best performing model was used eventually to predict the volume of stem in the forest stand. Statistical knowledge and methods were used in both the analysis and development of these models. In the end, a model that explained 99.99% variation in volume was gotten, which was a regression model with logarithmic correction. Insights were drawn and explanations given based on the analysis, visualizations, and model findings.
